<button class="collapsible">Our Server Rules</button>
<div class="content">

<p></b>Specific Game Rules</b><br><Br>
- Have respect for all players. Don't make any comments that you wouldn't say in real life. Remember the human on the other side of the screen.<br>
- Do not use any modifications that give you an advantage over other players. Clients such as Optifine and Badlion are allowed. You may use Minimap mods if they ONLY have a Minimap. A waypoint system is prohibited. Hacked clients and clients that give you advantages over players will result in a ban.<br>
- All discord chat rules apply to in-game chat.<br>
- TNT Duping and lag machines are not permitted on the server. Large-scale redstone contraptions are allowed however if they lag the server, moderators can tell you to switch it off/remove it.<br>
- Chunk loaders are not permitted<br>
- The use of alternate accounts to AFK is permitted however they must stay inside of your base. You may not use alternate accounts to bypass your ban. If the server hits the player limit, admins may kick alternate accounts and AFK users to make space.<br>
- Although you can build in unclaimed land, don't destroy the landscape too much.<br>
- Pirated minecraft clients are not permitted and will result in a permanent ip-ban.
<br><br>
<b>Discord Rules</b><br><br>
- No offensive nicknames, blank nicknames, "hoisting" nicknames (i.e nicknames starting with special characters to get you to the top of the list,) sexually explicit nicknames<br>
- Keep profile pictures in-line with Discord's ToS. This means no NSFW profile pictures.<br>
- Rules broken in DMs or off-platform communication apps will not be moderated.<br>
- Do not spam chat with large ammounts of text or with mentions. Spamming the "mc" channel will lose you access to that channel permanently.<br>
- Follow Discord's ToS and Community Guidelines. No Doxxing, child pornography or any other ToS-breaking content.<br>
- No illegal content.<br>
- Respect everyone regardless of opinion, politics, race, gender, sexuality etc.<br>
- This is not a place for you to find a girlfriend. Do not date or flirt.<br>
- English is the main language of the server however you are permitted to speak other languages freely. You may be asked to speak english if you're speaking too fast for mods to google translate, as mods have to make sure you aren't breaking the rules.<br>
- No advertisement.<br>
- no memes in general guys

<button class="collapsible">Stealing Guidelines</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>To declare war, you must ping the leader of the nation you're declaring war on. Only when the nation who you have declared war on has seen the declaration may you begin the war.<br><br>
During wartime you are permitted to break blocks and use TNT to grief any land inside of the nation's borders. You may not grief that nation's allies UNLESS those allies are actively fighting in the war.<br><br>
During a war, you may steal as much as you want from the chests and you can break blocks to access said chests.<br><br>
At least one member of the nation you're fighting and one moderator must be online during fighting, otherwise you may not be in that nation's land. If a nation refuses to join for over 24 hours to prevent you from griefing, you may start griefing and stealing as long as one moderator is online.<br><br>
There are a few conditions for winning a war:<br><br>
<b>Surrender</b><br>
If the nation you're fighting surrenders, you may annex all their land and their land now becomes part of your own land.<br><br>
<b>White Peace</b><br>White Peace is when both nations call a ceasefire and the war ends with the borders staying the same.<br><br>
<b>Annexation</b><br>This is when you have achieved a clear victory and the moderator of the war declares your victory.<br><br>
<b>Inactivity</b><br>If members of a nation refuse to join for 48 hours, you immediately win and annex their state.<br><br>

<b>A NATION IS PROTECTED FOR 7 DAYS AFTER IT'S CREATION. UNTIL A WEEK HAS PASSED AFTER IT'S CREATION, YOU MAY NOT DECLARE WAR ON IT AND IT CAN NOT DECLARE WAR ON ANYONE ELSE.<b></p>
