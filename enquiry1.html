    <h2>SMPGlobal Official Enquiry 1</h2>
    <p>After an inquiry from me and the staff team and reviewing the evidence, we have gathered a timeline of what has happened and have decided on the following result:</p><br>
    <p style="color:navy">Mithu: <span style="color:red;">3 day suspension from the staff team; no other punishment</span></p>
    <p style="color:navy">Gecko: <span style="color:green;">No punishment</span></p><br>
    <p>A lot of you may be asking on why we made this decision and we can answer with the following: We believe that this is the fairest decision that takes all sides into account and provides a punishment that is equal to the ammount of damage done. Only the person(s) punished may appeal; you may not appeal on someone else's behalf.</p>
